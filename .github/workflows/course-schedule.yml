          # a workflow_run was triggered (https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/25220),
          # so we'll do the slightly awkward thing and put that in the artifact. This means
          # schedules could potentially be spammed to any PR in the repository, but that is
          # not an awful outcome (and clear, reportable evidence of abuse).
