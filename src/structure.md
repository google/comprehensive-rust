# Course Structure

The course is fast-paced and we will cover a lot of ground over the next 3 to 4
days:

- Day 1: Basic Rust, ownership and the borrow checker.
- Day 2: Compound data types, pattern matching, the standard library.
- Day 3: Traits and generics, error handling, testing, unsafe Rust.
- Day 4: Concurrency in Rust and interoperatibilty with other languages

> **Exercise for Day 4:** Do you interface with some C/C++ code in your project
> which we could attempt to move to Rust? The fewer dependencies the better.
> Parsing code would be ideal.

## Format

The course is interactive and your questions will drive our exploration of Rust!

- Please ask questions when you get them, don't save them to the end.
- Discussions are very much encouraged!
- We will likely talk about things ahead of the slides.
  - The slides are just a support and we are free to skip them as we like.
