# Course Structure

The course is fast paced and we will cover a lot of ground over the next 3--4
days:

* Day 1: Basic Rust, ownership and the borrow checker.
* Day 2: Compound data types,  pattern matching, the standard library.
* Day 3: Traits and generics, error handling, testing, unsafe Rust.
* Day 4: Concurrency in Rust and interoperatibilty with other languages

> **Exercise for Day 4:** Do you interface with some C/C++ code in your project
> which we could attempt to move to Rust? The fewer dependencies the better.
> Parsing code would be ideal.

## Format

The course is interactive and your questions will drive our exploration of Rust!

* Please ask quesitons when you get then, don't save them to the end.
* Discussions are very much encouraged!
* We will likely talk about things ahead of the slides.
  * The slides are just a support and we are free to skip them as we like.
