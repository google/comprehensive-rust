# Welcome to Day 1

강의의 첫 날입니다. 우리는 오늘 많은 부분을 다룰 것입니다.
> This is the first day of Comprehensive Rust. We will cover a lot of ground today:

* 러스트 기본 문법: 변수, 스칼라 / 복합 타입, 열거형, 구조체, 참조형, 함수와 메서드.
> * Basic Rust syntax: variables, scalar and compound types, enums, structs,
  references, functions, and methods.

* 메모리 관리: 스택과 힙, 수동 메모리 관리, 스코프(범위)기반 메모리 관리, 가비지 컬렉션(GC)
> * Memory management: stack vs heap, manual memory management, scope-based memory
  management, and garbage collection.

* Ownership: move semantics, copying and cloning, borrowing, and lifetimes.

The idea for the first day is to show _just enough_ of Rust to be able to speak
about the famous borrow checker. The way Rust handles memory is a major feature
and we should show students this right away.

If you're teaching this in a classroom, this is a good place to go over the
schedule. We suggest splitting the day into two parts (following the slides):

* Morning: 9:00 to 12:00,
* Afternoon: 13:00 to 16:00.

You can of course adjust this as necessary. Please make sure to include breaks,
we recommend a break every hour!
