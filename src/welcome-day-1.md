# Welcome to Day 1

This is the first day of Comprehensive Rust. We will cover a lot of ground
today:

* Basic Rust syntax: variables, scalar and compound types, enums, structs,
  references, functions, and methods.

* Memory management: stack vs heap, manual memory management, scope-based memory
  management, and garbage collection.

* Ownership: move semantics, copying and cloning, borrowing, and lifetimes.
