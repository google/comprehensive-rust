# Glossary

The following is a glossary which aims to give a short definition of many Rust
terms. For translations, this also serves to connect the term back to the
English original.

}

h1#glossary ~ ul > li {
    /* Simplify with "text-indent: 2em hanging" when supported:

    padding-left: 2em;
    text-indent: -2em;
}

<!--
Translators: please add the English term in italic after your translated term.
Also, please keep the hard line breaks to ensure a nice formatting.
