# Important Traits

We will now look at some of the most common traits of the Rust standard library:

* `Iterator` and `IntoIterator` used in `for` loops,
* `From` and `Into` used to convert values,
* `Read` and `Write` used for IO,
* `Add`, `Mul`, ... used for operator overloading, and
* `Drop` used for defining destructors.
* `Default` used to construct a default instance of a type.
