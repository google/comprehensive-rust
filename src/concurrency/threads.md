# Threads

Rust threads work similarly to threads in other languages:

```rust,editable
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("Count in thread: {i}!");
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(5));
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("Main thread: {i}");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(5));
    }
}
```

- Threads are all daemon threads, the main thread does not wait for them.
- Thread panics are independent of each other.
  - Panics can carry a payload, which can be unpacked with `downcast_ref`.

- Rust thread APIs look not too different from e.g. C++ ones.

- Run the example.
  - 5ms timing is loose enough that main and spawned threads stay mostly in
    lockstep.
  - Notice that the program ends before the spawned thread reaches 10!
  - This is because main ends the program and spawned threads do not make it
    persist.
    - Compare to pthreads/C++ std::thread/boost::thread if desired.

- How do we wait around for the spawned thread to complete?
- [`thread::spawn`] returns a `JoinHandle`. Look at the docs.
  - `JoinHandle` has a [`.join()`] method that blocks.

- Use `let handle = thread::spawn(...)` and later `handle.join()` to wait for
  the thread to finish and have the program count all the way to 10.

- Now what if we want to return a value?
- Look at docs again:
  - [`thread::spawn`]'s closure returns `T`
  - `JoinHandle` [`.join()`] returns `thread::Result<T>`

- Use the `Result` return value from `handle.join()` to get access to the
  returned value.

- Ok, what about the other case?
  - Trigger a panic in the thread. Note that this doesn't panic `main`.
  - Access the panic payload. This is a good time to talk about [`Any`].

- Now we can return values from threads! What about taking inputs?
  - Capture something by reference in the thread closure.
  - An error message indicates we must move it.
  - Move it in, see we can compute and then return a derived value.

- If we want to borrow?
  - Main kills child threads when it returns, but another function would just
    return and leave them running.
  - That would be stack use-after-return, which violates memory safety!
  - How do we avoid this? see next slide.
