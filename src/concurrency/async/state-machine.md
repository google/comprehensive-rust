# State Machine

Rust transforms an async function or block to a hidden type that implements
`Future`, using a state machine to track the function's progress. The details of
this transform are complex, but it helps to have a schematic understanding of
what is happening. The following function

```rust,compile_fail
/// Sum two D10 rolls plus a modifier.
async fn two_d10(modifier: u32) -> u32 {
    let first_roll = roll_d10().await;
    let second_roll = roll_d10().await;
    first_roll + second_roll + modifier
}
```

is transformed to something like

```rust,editable,compile_fail
use std::future::Future;
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

/// Sum two D10 rolls plus a modifier.
fn two_d10(modifier: u32) -> TwoD10 {
    TwoD10::Init { modifier }
}

enum TwoD10 {
    // Function has not begun yet.
    Init { modifier: u32 },
    // Waiting for first `.await` to complete.
    FirstRoll { modifier: u32, fut: RollD10Future },
    // Waiting for second `.await` to complete.
    SecondRoll { modifier: u32, first_roll: u32, fut: RollD10Future },
}

impl Future for TwoD10 {
    type Output = u32;
    fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, ctx: &mut Context) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        loop {
            match *self {
                TwoD10::Init { modifier } => {
                    // Create future for first dice roll.
                    let fut = roll_d10();
                    *self = TwoD10::FirstRoll { modifier, fut };
                }
                TwoD10::FirstRoll { modifier, ref mut fut } => {
                    // Poll sub-future for first dice roll.
                    if let Poll::Ready(first_roll) = fut.poll(ctx) {
                        // Create future for second roll.
                        let fut = roll_d10();
                        *self = TwoD10::SecondRoll { modifier, first_roll, fut };
                    } else {
                        return Poll::Pending;
                    }
                }
                TwoD10::SecondRoll { modifier, first_roll, ref mut fut } => {
                    // Poll sub-future for second dice roll.
                    if let Poll::Ready(second_roll) = fut.poll(ctx) {
                        return Poll::Ready(first_roll + second_roll + modifier);
                    } else {
                        return Poll::Pending;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<details>

This example is illustrative, and isn't an accurate representation of the Rust
compiler's transformation. The important things to notice here are:

- Calling an async function does nothing but construct and return a future.
- All local variables are stored in the function's future, using an enum to
  identify where execution is currently suspended.
- An `.await` in the async function is translated into an a new state containing
  all live variables and the awaited future. The `loop` then handles that
  updated state, polling the future until it returns `Poll::Ready`.
- Execution continues eagerly until a `Poll::Pending` occurs. In this simple
  example, every future is ready immediately.
- `main` contains a na√Øve executor, which just busy-loops until the future is
  ready. We will discuss real executors shortly.

# More to Explore

Imagine the `Future` data structure for a deeply nested stack of async
functions. Each function's `Future` contains the `Future` structures for the
functions it calls. This can result in unexpectedly large compiler-generated
`Future` types.

This also means that recursive async functions are challenging. Compare to the
common error of building recursive type, such as

```rust,compile_fail
enum LinkedList<T> {
    Node { value: T, next: LinkedList<T> },
    Nil,
}
```

The fix for a recursive type is to add a layer of indrection, such as with
`Box`. Similarly, a recursive async function must box the recursive future:

```rust,editable
async fn count_to(n: u32) {
    if n > 0 {
        Box::pin(count_to(n - 1)).await;
        println!("{n}");
    }
}
```
