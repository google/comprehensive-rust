# `Send` and `Sync`

How does Rust know to forbid shared access across threads? The answer is in two traits:

* [`Send`][1]: a type `T` is `Send` if it is safe to move a `T` across a thread
  boundary.
* [`Sync`][2]: a type `T` is `Sync` if it is safe to move a `&T` across a thread
  boundary.

`Send` and `Sync` are [unsafe traits][3]. The compiler will automatically derive them for your types
as long as they only contain `Send` and `Sync` types. You can also implement them manually when you
know it is valid.

* One can think of these traits as markers that the type has certain thread-safety properties.
* They can be used in the generic constraints as normal traits.
