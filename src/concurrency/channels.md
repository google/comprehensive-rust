# Channels

Rust channels have two parts: a `Sender<T>` and a `Receiver<T>`. The two parts
are connected via the channel, but you only see the end-points.

```rust,editable
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    tx.send(10).unwrap();
    tx.send(20).unwrap();

    println!("Received: {:?}", rx.recv());
    println!("Received: {:?}", rx.recv());

    let tx2 = tx.clone();
    tx2.send(30).unwrap();
    println!("Received: {:?}", rx.recv());
}
```

<details>

* `mpsc` stands for Multi-Producer, Single-Consumer. `Sender` and `SyncSender` implement `Clone` (so
  you can make multiple producers) but `Receiver` does not.
* `send()` and `recv()` return `Result`. If they return `Err`, it means the counterpart `Sender` or
  `Receiver` is dropped and the channel is closed.
