# Shared State

Rust uses the type system to enforce synchronization of shared data. This is
primarily done via two types:

- [`Arc<T>`][1], atomic reference counted `T`: handled sharing between threads and
  takes care to deallocate `T` when the last thread exists,
- [`Mutex<T>`][2]: ensures mutual exclusion for to the `T` value.
