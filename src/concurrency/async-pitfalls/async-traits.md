# Async Traits

Async methods in traits are were stabilized in the 1.75 release. This required
support for using return-position `impl Trait` in traits, as the desugaring for
`async fn` includes `-> impl Future<Output = ...>`.

However, even with the native support, there are some pitfalls around
`async fn`:

- Return-position `impl Trait` captures all in-scope lifetimes (so some patterns
  of borrowing cannot be expressed).

- Async traits cannot be used with [trait objects] (`dyn Trait` support).

The [async_trait] crate provides a workaround for `dyn` support through a macro,
with some caveats:

```rust,editable,compile_fail
{{#include async-traits.rs}}
```

<details>

- `async_trait` is easy to use, but note that it's using heap allocations to
  achieve this. This heap allocation has performance overhead.

- The challenges in language support for `async trait` are too deep to describe
  in-depth in this class. See [this blog post] by Niko Matsakis if you are
  interested in digging deeper. See also these keywords:

  - [RPIT]: short for
    [return-position `impl Trait`](../../generics/impl-trait.md).
  - [RPITIT]: short for return-position `impl Trait` in trait (RPIT in trait).

- Try creating a new sleeper struct that will sleep for a random amount of time
  and adding it to the `Vec`.
