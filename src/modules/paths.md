# Paths

Paths are resolved as follows:

1. As a relative path:
   - `foo` or `self::foo` refers to `foo` in the current module,
   - `super::foo` refers to `foo` in the parent module.

2. As an absolute path:
   - `crate::foo` refers to `foo` in the root of the current crate,
   - `bar::foo` refers to `foo` in the `bar` crate.
