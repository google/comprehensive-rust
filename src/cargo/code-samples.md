# Code Samples in This Training

For this training, we will mostly explore the Rust language through examples
which can be executed through your browser. This makes the setup much easier and
ensures a consistent experience for everyone.

Installing Cargo is still encouraged: it will make it easier for you to do the
exercises. On the last day, we will do a larger exercise which shows you how to
work with dependencies and for that you need Cargo.

The code blocks in this course are fully interactive:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    println!("Edit me!");
}
```

You can use <kbd>Ctrl + Enter</kbd> to execute the code when focus is in the
text box.

Most code samples are editable like shown above. A few code samples are not
editable for various reasons:

- The embedded playgrounds cannot execute unit tests. Copy-paste the code and
  open it in the real Playground to demonstrate unit tests.

- The embedded playgrounds lose their state the moment you navigate away from
  the page! This is the reason that the students should solve the exercises
  using a local Rust installation or via the Playground.
