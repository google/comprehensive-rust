# Welcome to Day 3

Today, we will cover some more advanced topics of Rust:

- Traits: deriving traits, default methods, and important standard library
  traits.

- Generics: generic data types, generic methods, monomorphization, and trait
  objects.

- Error handling: panics, `Result`, and the try operator `?`.

- Testing: unit tests, documentation tests, and integration tests.

- Unsafe Rust: raw pointers, static variables, unsafe functions, and extern
  functions.
