# Welcome to Day 3

We have now seen all the core language features:

- **Foundations:** Basic types, control flow, functions, and data structures.
- **Pattern Matching:** Destructuring data effectively.
- **Polymorphism:** Methods, Traits, and Generics.
- **Standard Library:** Using essential types like `Option`, `Result`, `Vec`,
  and `String`.
- **Closures:** Anonymous functions that can capture their environment.

You can write any type and associate behavior with it. We are now shifting gears
to apply these concepts to memory management and system design.
