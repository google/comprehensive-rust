# Enums

The `enum` keyword allows the creation of a type which has a few different
variants:

```rust,editable
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Direction {
    Left,
    Right,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum PlayerMove {
    Pass,                        // Simple variant
    Run(Direction),              // Tuple variant
    Teleport { x: u32, y: u32 }, // Struct variant
}

fn main() {
    let m: PlayerMove = PlayerMove::Run(Direction::Left);
    println!("On this turn: {:?}", m);
}
```

<details>

Key Points:

- Enumerations allow you to collect a set of values under one type.
- `Direction` is a type with variants. There are two values of `Direction`:
  `Direction::Left` and `Direction::Right`.
- `PlayerMove` is a type with three variants. In addition to the payloads, Rust
  will store a discriminant so that it knows at runtime which variant is in a
  `PlayerMove` value.
- This might be a good time to compare structs and enums:
  - In both, you can have a simple version without fields (unit struct) or one
    with different types of fields (variant payloads).
  - You could even implement the different variants of an enum with separate
    structs but then they wouldnâ€™t be the same type as they would if they were
    all defined in an enum.
- Rust uses minimal space to store the discriminant.
  - If necessary, it stores an integer of the smallest required size
  - If the allowed variant values do not cover all bit patterns, it will use
    invalid bit patterns to encode the discriminant (the "niche optimization").
    For example, `Option<&u8>` stores either a pointer to an integer or `NULL`
    for the `None` variant.
  - You can control the discriminant if needed (e.g., for compatibility with C):

    <!-- mdbook-xgettext: skip -->
    ```rust,editable
    #[repr(u32)]
    enum Bar {
        A, // 0
        B = 10000,
        C, // 10001
    }

    fn main() {
        println!("A: {}", Bar::A as u32);
        println!("B: {}", Bar::B as u32);
        println!("C: {}", Bar::C as u32);
    }
    ```

    Without `repr`, the discriminant type takes 2 bytes, because 10001 fits 2
    bytes.

## More to Explore

Rust has several optimizations it can employ to make enums take up less space.

- Null pointer optimization: For
  [some types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/#representation), Rust
  guarantees that `size_of::<T>()` equals `size_of::<Option<T>>()`.

  Example code if you want to show how the bitwise representation _may_ look
  like in practice. It's important to note that the compiler provides no
  guarantees regarding this representation, therefore this is totally unsafe.

  <!-- mdbook-xgettext: skip -->
  ```rust,editable
  use std::mem::transmute;

  macro_rules! dbg_bits {
      ($e:expr, $bit_type:ty) => {
          println!(
              "- {}: {:#x}", 
              stringify!($e), 
              transmute::<_, $bit_type>($e)
          );
      };
  }

  fn main() {
      unsafe {
          println!("bool:");
          dbg_bits!(false, u8);
          dbg_bits!(true, u8);

          println!("Option<bool>:");
          dbg_bits!(None::<bool>, u8);
          dbg_bits!(Some(false), u8);
          dbg_bits!(Some(true), u8);

          println!("Option<Option<bool>>:");
          dbg_bits!(Some(Some(false)), u8);
          dbg_bits!(Some(Some(true)), u8);
          dbg_bits!(Some(None::<bool>), u8);
          dbg_bits!(None::<Option<bool>>, u8);

          println!("Option<&i32>:");
          dbg_bits!(None::<&i32>, usize);
          dbg_bits!(Some(&0i32), usize);
      }
  }
  ```
