# Exercise: Elevator Events

We will create a data structure to represent an event in an elevator control
system. It is up to you to define the types and functions to construct various
events. Use `#[derive(Debug)]` to allow the types to be formatted with `{:?}`.

This exercise only requires creating and populating data structures so that
`main` runs without errors. The next part of the course will cover getting data
out of these structures.

```rust,editable,should_panic
{{#include exercise.rs:event}}
    // TODO: add required variants
}

{{#include exercise.rs:direction}}

{{#include exercise.rs:car_arrived}}
    todo!()
}

{{#include exercise.rs:car_door_opened}}
    todo!()
}

{{#include exercise.rs:car_door_closed}}
    todo!()
}

{{#include exercise.rs:lobby_call_button_pressed}}
    todo!()
}

{{#include exercise.rs:car_floor_button_pressed}}
    todo!()
}

{{#include exercise.rs:main}}
```
