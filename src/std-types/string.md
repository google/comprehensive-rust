# String

[`String`][1] is a growable UTF-8 encoded string:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let mut s1 = String::new();
    s1.push_str("Hello");
    println!("s1: len = {}, capacity = {}", s1.len(), s1.capacity());

    let mut s2 = String::with_capacity(s1.len() + 1);
    s2.push_str(&s1);
    s2.push('!');
    println!("s2: len = {}, capacity = {}", s2.len(), s2.capacity());

    let s3 = String::from("ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­");
    println!("s3: len = {}, number of chars = {}", s3.len(), s3.chars().count());
}
```

`String` implements [`Deref<Target = str>`][2], which means that you can call
all `str` methods on a `String`.

<details>

- `String::new` returns a new empty string, use `String::with_capacity` when you
  know how much data you want to push to the string.
- `String::len` returns the size of the `String` in bytes (which can be
  different from its length in characters).
- `String::chars` returns an iterator over the actual characters. Note that a
  `char` can be different from what a human will consider a "character" due to
  [grapheme clusters](https://docs.rs/unicode-segmentation/latest/unicode_segmentation/struct.Graphemes.html).
- When people refer to strings they could either be talking about `&str` or
  `String`.
- When a type implements `Deref<Target = T>`, the compiler will let you
  transparently call methods from `T`.
  - We haven't discussed the `Deref` trait yet, so at this point this mostly
    explains the structure of the sidebar in the documentation.
  - `String` implements `Deref<Target = str>` which transparently gives it
    access to `str`'s methods.
  - Write and compare `let s3 = s1.deref();` and `let s3 = &*s1;`.
- `String` is implemented as a wrapper around a vector of bytes, many of the
  operations you see supported on vectors are also supported on `String`, but
  with some extra guarantees.
- Compare the different ways to index a `String`:
  - To a character by using `s3.chars().nth(i).unwrap()` where `i` is in-bound,
    out-of-bounds.
  - To a substring by using `s3[0..4]`, where that slice is on character
    boundaries or not.
- Many types can be converted to a string with the
  [`to_string`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/trait.ToString.html#tymethod.to_string)
  method. This trait is automatically implemented for all types that implement
  `Display`, so anything that can be formatted can also be converted to a
  string.
