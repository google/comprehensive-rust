Traditionally, languages have fallen into two broad categories:

- Full control via manual memory management: C, C++, Pascal, ...
- Full safety via automatic memory management at runtime: Java, Python, Go, Haskell, ...

> Full control _and_ safety via compile time enforcement of correct memory
> management.

First, let's refresh how memory management works.
