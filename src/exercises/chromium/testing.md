# Testing exercise

Time for another exercise!

In your Chromium build:

- Add a testable function next to `hello_from_rust`. Some suggestions: adding
  two integers received as arguments, computing the nth Fibonacci number,
  summing integers in a slice, etc.
- Add a separate `..._unittest.rs` file with a test for the new function.
- Add the new tests to `BUILD.gn`.
- Build the tests, run them, and verify that the new test works.
