# Bringing it together --- Exercise

In this exercise, you're going to add a whole new Chromium feature, bringing
together everything you already learned.

## The brief from Product Management

A community of pixies has been discovered living in a remote rainforest.
It's important that we get Chromium for Pixies delivered to them as soon
as possible.

The requirement is to translate all Chromium's UI strings into Pixie language.

There's not time to wait for proper translations, but fortunately pixie
language is very close to English, and it turns out there's a Rust crate
which does the translation.

In fact, you already [imported that crate in the previous exercise][0].

(Obviously, real translations of Chrome require incredible care and
diligence. Don't ship this!)

## Steps

Modify `ResourceBundle::MaybeMangleLocalizedString` so that it uwuifies
all strings before display. In this special build of Chromium, it should
always do this irrespective of the setting of `mangle_localized_strings_`.

If you've done everything right across all these exercises, congratulations,
you should have created Chrome for pixies!

Students will likely need some hints here. Hints include:

* UTF16 vs UTF8. Students should be aware that Rust strings are always
  UTF8, and will probably decide that it's better to do the conversion
  on the C++ side using `base::UTF16ToUTF8` and back again.
* If students decide to do the conversion on the Rust side, they'll need to
  consider [`std::string::from_utf16`][1], consider error handling, and
  consider which [cxx supported types can transfer a lot of u16s][2].
* Students may design the C++/Rust boundary in several different ways,
  e.g. taking and returning strings by value, or taking a mutable reference
  to a string. If a mutable reference is used, cxx will likely
  tell the student that they need to use [`Pin`][3]. You may need to explain
  what `Pin` does, and then explain why `cxx` needs it for mutable references
  to C++ data: the answer is that C++ data can't be moved around like Rust
  data, because it may contain self-referential pointers.
* The C++ target containing `ResourceBundle::MaybeMangleLocalizedString`
  will need to depend on a `rust_static_library` target. The student
  probably already did this.
* The `rust_static_library` target will need to depend on
  `//third_party/rust/uwuify/v0_2:lib`.
