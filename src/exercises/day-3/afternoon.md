# Day 3: Afternoon Exercises

Let us build a safe wrapper for reading directory content!

For this exercise, we suggest attempting to use a local dev environment instead

binary on your own machine.

To get started, follow the [running locally] instructions.

[running locally]: ../../cargo/running-locally.md
