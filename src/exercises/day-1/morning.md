# Day 1: Morning Exercises

In these exercises, we will explore two parts of Rust:

* Implicit conversions between types.

* Arrays and `for` loops.

A few things to consider while solving the exercises:

* Use a local Rust installation, if possible. This way you can get
  auto-completion in your editor. See the page about [Using Cargo] for details
  on installing Rust.

* Alternatively, use the Rust Playground.

The code snippets are not editable on purpose: the inline code snippets lose
their state if you navigate away from the page.

After looking at the exercises, you can look at the [solutions] provided.
