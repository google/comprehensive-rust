# Exercises

This is a group exercise: We will look at one of the projects you work with and
try to integrate some Rust into it. Some suggestions:

- Call your AIDL service with a client written in Rust.

- Move a function from your project to Rust and call it.

No solution is provided here since this is open-ended: it relies on someone in
the class having a piece of code which you can turn in to Rust on the fly.
