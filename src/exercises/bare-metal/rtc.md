# RTC driver

The QEMU aarch64 virt machine has a [PL031][1] real-time clock at 0x9010000. For this exercise, you
should write a driver for it.

1. Use it to print the current time to the serial console. You can use the [`chrono`][2] crate for
   date/time formatting.
2. Use the match register and raw interrupt status to busy-wait until a given time, e.g. 3 seconds
   in the future. (Call [`core::hint::spin_loop`][3] inside the loop.)
3. _Extension if you have time:_ Enable and handle the interrupt generated by the RTC match. You can
   use the driver provided in the [`arm-gic`][4] crate to configure the Arm Generic Interrupt Controller.
   - Use the RTC interrupt, which is wired to the GIC as `IntId::spi(2)`.
   - Once the interrupt is enabled, you can put the core to sleep via `arm_gic::wfi()`, which will cause the core to sleep until it receives an interrupt.
   

Download the [exercise template](../../comprehensive-rust-exercises.zip) and look in the `rtc`
directory for the following files.

<!-- File src/main.rs -->

```rust,compile_fail
{{#include rtc/src/main.rs:top}}

{{#include rtc/src/main.rs:imports}}

{{#include rtc/src/main.rs:main}}

    // TODO: Create instance of RTC driver and print current time.

    // TODO: Wait for 3 seconds.

{{#include rtc/src/main.rs:main_end}}
