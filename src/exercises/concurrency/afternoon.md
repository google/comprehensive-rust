# Exercises

To practice your Async Rust skills, we have again two exercises for you:

* Dining philosophers: we already saw this problem in the morning. This time
  you are going to implement it with Async Rust.

* A Broadcast Chat Application: this is a larger project that allows you
  experiment with more advanced Async Rust features.
