# Exercises

To practice your Async Rust skills, we have again two exercises for you:

* Dining philosophers: we already saw this problem in the morning. This time
  you are going to implement it with Async Rust.

* The Elevator Problem: this is a larger project that allows you experiment
  with more advanced Async Rust features and some of its pitfalls!

After looking at the exercises, you can look at the [solutions] provided.
