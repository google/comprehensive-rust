# Automatic Memory Management

An alternative to manual and scope-based memory management is automatic memory
management:

- The programmer never calls allocates or deallocates memory explicitly.
- A garbage collector finds unused memory and deallocates it for the programmer.

## Java Example

The `person` object is not deallocated after `sayHello` returns:

```java
void sayHello(Person person) {
  System.out.println("Hello " + person.getName());
}
```
