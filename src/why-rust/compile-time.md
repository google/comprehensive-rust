# Compile Time Guarantees

Static memory management at compile time:

- No uninitialized variables.
- _Mostly_ no memory leaks[^leaks].
- No double-frees.
- No use-after-free.
- No `NULL` pointers.
- No forgotten locked mutexes.
- No data races between threads.
- No iterator invalidation.

[^leaks]: It is technically possible to produce a memory leak in (safe) Rust. The [`Box::leak`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.leak) method allows getting a raw reference out of a [`Box`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) and dropping the [`Box`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) afterwards, without running the destructor. A use of this could be to get runtime-initialized and runtime-sized static variables. Or simply, the [`std::mem::forget`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.forget.html) function, which makes the compiler "forget" about a value meaning the destructor is never run. There are many other ways to create leaks in safe Rust, but for the purpose of this course, "No memory leaks" should be understood as "Pretty much no _accidental_ memory leaks".
