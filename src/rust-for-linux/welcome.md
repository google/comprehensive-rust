# Welcome to Rust for Linux

The Linux Kernel is currently working to add support for developing with the
Rust programming language.

This involves considerations on both sides of the equation - Linux and Rust.

Rust must conform to the non-negotiable requirements Linux imposes on compile-
and run-time behavior of its core and modules. Meanwhile, Linux must expose its
existing functionality in ways that Rust can access as efficiently and safely
as possible.

We'll look at the general background, get our hands dirty with some existing
Rust code in Linux, and then explore particular integration challenges, both
resolved and ongoing.
