# Next Steps

The Linux documentation has a number of
[pointers to further resources](https://docs.kernel.org/process/kernel-docs.html#rust) on using Rust in the kernel.

The Rust for Linux project lists various avenues for [contacting the project](https://rust-for-linux.com/contact).

The [Rust for Linux Zulip](https://rust-for-linux.zulipchat.com/) is particularly active and a good starting point for inquiries.
