# Methods

Rust has methods, they are simply functions that are associated with a particular type. The
first argument of a method is an instance of the type it is associated with:

```rust,editable
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn inc_width(&mut self, delta: u32) {
        self.width += delta;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 5 };
    println!("old area: {}", rect.area());
    rect.inc_width(5);
    println!("new area: {}", rect.area());
}
```

* We will look much more at methods in today's exercise and in tomorrow's class.
