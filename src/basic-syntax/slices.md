# Slices

A slice gives you a view into a larger collection:

<!-- mdbook-xgettext: skip -->
```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let mut a: [i32; 6] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60];
    println!("a: {a:?}");

    let s: &[i32] = &a[2..4];

    println!("s: {s:?}");
}
```

* Slices borrow data from the sliced type.
* Question: What happens if you modify `a[3]` right before printing `s`?

<details>

* We create a slice by borrowing `a` and specifying the starting and ending indexes in brackets.

* If the slice starts at index 0, Rustâ€™s range syntax allows us to drop the starting index, meaning that `&a[0..a.len()]` and `&a[..a.len()]` are identical.
    
* The same is true for the last index, so `&a[2..a.len()]` and `&a[2..]` are identical.

* To easily create a slice of the full array, we can therefore use `&a[..]`.

* `s` is a reference to a slice of `i32`s. Notice that the type of `s` (`&[i32]`) no longer mentions the array length. This allows us to perform computation on slices of different sizes.
 
* Slices always borrow from another object. In this example, `a` has to remain 'alive' (in scope) for at least as long as our slice. 
    
* The question about modifying `a[3]` can spark an interesting discussion, but the answer is that for memory safety reasons
  you cannot do it through `a` at this point in the execution, but you can read the data from both `a` and `s` safely.
  It works before you created the slice, and again after the `println`, when the slice is no longer used. More details will be explained in the borrow checker section.
