# Using Cargo

When you start reading about Rust, you will soon meet [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), the standard tool
used in the Rust ecosystem to build and run Rust applications. Here we want to
give a brief overview of what Cargo is and how it fits into the wider ecosystem
and how it fits into this training.

On Debian/Ubuntu, you can install Cargo and the Rust source with

```shell
sudo apt install cargo rust-src
```

This will allow [rust-analyzer][1] to jump to the definitions. We suggest using
[VS Code][2] to edit the code (but any LSP compatible editor works).
