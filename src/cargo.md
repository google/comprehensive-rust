# Using Cargo

When you start reading about Rust, you will soon meet Cargo, the standard tool
used in the Rust ecosystem to build and run Rust applications. Here we want to
give a brief overview of what Cargo is and how it fits into the wider ecosystem
and how it fits into this training.

On Debian/Ubuntu, you can install Cargo and the Rust source with

```shell
$ sudo apt install cargo rust-src
```

This will allow [rust-analyzer][1] to jump to the definitions. We suggest using
[VS Code][2] to edit the code (but any LSP compatible editor works).
