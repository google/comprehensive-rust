# Welcome to Day 4

This morning, we will focus on Concurrency: threads, channels, shared state, `Send` and `Sync`.
In the afternoon, we will have a chance to see Rust in action.

This is a good time to give an outline of what you will cover in the afternoon
section, as announced in the course offering.
