# Welcome to Day 4

We have mastered the core language and its unique safety model:

- **Foundations & Abstraction:** Traits, generics, and the standard library.
- **Ownership:** Move semantics and the `Drop` trait.
- **Memory Management:** Borrowing rules (`&` vs `&mut`) and lifetimes.
- **Smart Pointers:** `Box`, `Rc`, and `RefCell` for complex data structures.

You now understand how Rust guarantees memory safety at compile time! Today we
focus on applying this knowledge to build robust, large-scale applications.
