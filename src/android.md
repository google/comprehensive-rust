# Welcome to Rust in Android

This is a one-day course about Rust in Android: you can write new Android
platform services, libraries, drivers or even firmware in Rust.

## Target Audience

This course builds on [Rust Fundamentals](welcome-day-1.md) and we expect you
are familiar with the basics of Rust. You should also be familiar with
development on the Android Platform (AOSP).

## Class Format

The class is meant to be very interactive! Please ask questions to drive the
exploration of Rust!

> We will attempt to call Rust from one of your own projects today. So try to
> find a little corner of your code base where we can move some lines of code to
> Rust. The fewer dependencies and "exotic" types the better. Something that
> parses some raw bytes would be ideal.
