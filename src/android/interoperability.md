# Interoperability

Rust has excellent support for interoperability with other languages. This means
that you can:

- Call Rust functions from other languages.
- Call functions written in other languages from Rust.

When you call functions in a foreign language we say that you're using a
_foreign function interface_, also known as FFI.
