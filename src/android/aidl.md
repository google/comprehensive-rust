# AIDL

Rust supports the
[Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL)](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl):

- Rust code can call existing AIDL servers.
- You can create new AIDL servers in Rust.

- AIDL enables Android apps to interact with each other.

- Since Rust is a first-class citizen in this ecosystem, other processes on the
  device can call Rust services.
