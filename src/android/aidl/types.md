# Working With AIDL Types

AIDL types translate into the appropriate idiomatic Rust type:

- Primitive types map (mostly) to idiomatic Rust types.
- Collection types like slices, `Vec`s and string types are supported.
- References to AIDL objects and file handles can be sent between clients and
  services.
- File handles and parcelables are fully supported.
