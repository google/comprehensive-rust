# Ownership

All variable bindings have a _scope_ where they are valid and it is an error to
use a variable outside its scope:

<!-- mdbook-xgettext: skip -->
```rust,editable,compile_fail
struct Point(i32, i32);

fn main() {
    {
        let p = Point(3, 4);
        println!("x: {}", p.0);
    }
    println!("y: {}", p.1);
}
```

* At the end of the scope, the variable is _dropped_ and the data is freed.
* A destructor can run here to free up resources.
* We say that the variable _owns_ the value.
