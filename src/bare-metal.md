# Welcome to Bare Metal Rust

This is a one-day course about bare-metal Rust: running Rust code without an OS
underneath us.

The class is divided into several parts:

- What is `no_std` Rust?
- Writing firmware for microcontrollers.
- Writing bootloader / kernel code for application processors.
- Some useful crates for bare-metal Rust development.

## Target Audience

This course builds on [Rust Fundamentals](welcome-day-1.md) and we expect you
are familiar with the basics of Rust. You should ideally also have some
experience with bare-metal programming in some other language such as C.
