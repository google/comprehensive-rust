# Basic Syntax

Much of the Rust syntax will be familiar to you from C or C++:

* Blocks and scopes are delimited by curly braces.
* Line comments are started with `//`, block comments are delimited by `/* ...
  */`.
* Keywords like `if` and `while` work the same.
* Variable assigment is done with `=`, comparison is done with `==`.
