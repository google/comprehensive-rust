# Basic Syntax

Much of the Rust syntax will be familiar to you from C or C++:

- Blocks and scopes are delimited by curly braces.
- Line comments are started with `//`, block comments are delimited by `/* ... */`.
- Keywords like `if` and `while` work the same.
- Variable assignment is done with `=`, comparison is done with `==`.
