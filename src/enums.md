# Enums

The `enum` keyword allows the creation of a type which has a few
different variants:

```rust,editable
fn generate_random_number() -> i32 {
    // Implementation based on https://xkcd.com/221/
    4  // Chosen by fair dice roll. Guaranteed to be random.
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum CoinFlip {
    Heads,
    Tails,
}

fn flip_coin() -> CoinFlip {
    let random_number = generate_random_number();
    if random_number % 2 == 0 {
        return CoinFlip::Heads;
    } else {
        return CoinFlip::Tails;
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("You got: {:?}", flip_coin());
}
```

Key Points:

* Enumerations allow you to collect a set of values under one type
* This page offers an enum type `CoinFlip` with two variants `Heads` and `Tails`. You might note the namespace when using variants.
* This might be a good time to compare Structs and Enums:
  * In both, you can have a simple version without fields (unit struct) or one with different types of fields (variant payloads). 
  * In both, associated functions are defined within an `impl` block.
  * You could even implement the different variants of an enum with separate structs but then they wouldnâ€™t be the same type as they would if they were all defined in an enum.
