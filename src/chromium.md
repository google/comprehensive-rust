# Welcome to Rust in Chromium

Rust is supported for third-party libraries in Chromium, with first-party glue
code to connect between Rust and existing Chromium C++ code.

> Today, we'll call into Rust to do something silly with strings. If you've got
> a corner of the code where you're displaying a UTF8 string to the user, feel
> free to follow this recipe in your part of the codebase instead of the exact
> part we talk about.
