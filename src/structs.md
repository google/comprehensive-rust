# Structs

Like C and C++, Rust has support for custom structs:

```rust,editable
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}

fn main() {
    let mut peter = Person {
        name: String::from("Peter"),
        age: 27,
    };
    println!("{} is {} years old", peter.name, peter.age);
    
    peter.age = 28;
    println!("{} is {} years old", peter.name, peter.age);
    
    let jackie = Person {
        name: String::from("Jackie"),
        ..peter
    };
    println!("{} is {} years old", jackie.name, jackie.age);
}
```
