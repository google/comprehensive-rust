# Structs

Like C and C++, Rust has support for custom structs:

```rust,editable
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}

fn main() {
    let mut peter = Person {
        name: String::from("Peter"),
        age: 27,
    };
    println!("{} is {} years old", peter.name, peter.age);
    
    peter.age = 28;
    println!("{} is {} years old", peter.name, peter.age);
    
    let jackie = Person {
        name: String::from("Jackie"),
        ..peter
    };
    println!("{} is {} years old", jackie.name, jackie.age);
}
```

Key Points:

* Structs work like in C or C++.
  * Like in C++, and unlike in C, no typedef is needed to define a type.
  * Unlike in C++, there is no inheritance between structs.
* Methods are defined in an `impl` block, which we will see in following slides.
* This may be a good time to let people know there are different types of structs. 
  * Zero-sized structs `e.g., struct Foo;` might be used when implementing a trait on some type but donâ€™t have any data that you want to store in the value itself. 
  * The next slide will introduce Tuple structs, used when the field names are not important.
* The syntax `..peter` allows us to copy the majority of the fields from the old struct without having to explicitly type it all out. It must always be the last element.
