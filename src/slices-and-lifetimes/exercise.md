# Exercise: Protobuf Parsing

In this exercise, you will build a parser for the [protobuf binary
encoding](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/). Don't worry, it's
simpler than it seems! This illustrates a common parsing pattern, passing slices
of data. The underlying data itself is never copied.

Fully parsing a protobuf message requires knowing the types of the fields,
indexed by their field numbers. That is typically provided in a `proto` file. In
this exercise, we'll encode that information into `match` statements in
functions that get called for each field.

We'll use the following proto:

```proto
message PhoneNumber {
  optional string number = 1;
  optional string type = 2;
}

message Person {
  optional string name = 1;
  optional int32 id = 2;
  repeated PhoneNumber phones = 3;
}
```

A proto message is encoded as a series of fields, one after the next. Each is
implemented as a "tag" followed by the value. The tag contains a field number
(e.g., `2` for the `id` field of a `Person` message) and a wire type defining
how the payload should be determined from the byte stream.

Integers, including the tag, are represented with a variable-length encoding
called VARINT. Luckily, `parse_varint` is defined for you below. The given code
also defines callbacks to handle `Person` and `PhoneNumber` fields, and to parse
a message into a series of calls to those callbacks.

What remains for you is to implement the `parse_field` function and the
`ProtoMessage` trait for `Person` and `PhoneNumber`.

{{#include exercise.rs:preliminaries }}


{{#include exercise.rs:parse_field }}
    // 1. Read and unpack the tag, which is a varint.
    // 2. Based on the wire type, build a Field, consuming as many bytes as
    //    necessary.
    // 3. Return the field, and any un-consumed bytes.
