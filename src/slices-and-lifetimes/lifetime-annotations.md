# Lifetime Annotations

A reference has a _lifetime_, which must not "outlive" the value it refers to.
This is verified by the borrow checker.

The lifetime can be implicit - this is what we have seen so far.  Lifetimes can
also be explicit: `&'a Point`, `&'document str`.  Lifetimes start with `'` and
`'a` is a typical default name.  Read `&'a Point` as "a borrowed `Point` which
is valid for at least the lifetime `a`".

Lifetimes are always inferred by the compiler: you cannot assign a lifetime
yourself. Explicit lifetime annotations create constraints where there is
ambiguity; the compiler verifies that there is a valid solution.

Lifetimes become more complicated when considering passing values to and
returning values from functions.

```rust,editable,compile_fail
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point(i32, i32);

fn left_most(p1: &Point, p2: &Point) -> &Point {
  if p1.0 < p2.0 { p1 } else { p2 }
}

fn main() {
  let p1: Point = Point(10, 10);
  let p2: Point = Point(20, 20);
  let p3 = left_most(&p1, &p2); // What is the lifetime of p3?
  println!("p3: {p3:?}");
}
```

<details>

In this example, the the compiler does not know what lifetime to infer for
`p3`. Looking inside the function body shows that it can only safely assume
that `p3`'s lifetime is the shorter of `p1` and `p2`. But just like types, Rust
requires explicit annotations of lifetimes on function arguments and return
values.

Add `'a` appropriately to `left_most`:

```rust,ignore
fn left_most<'a>(p1: &'a Point, p2: &'a Point) -> &'a Point {
```

This says, "given p1 and p2 which both outlive `'a`, the return value lives for at least `'a`.

In common cases, lifetimes can be elided, as described on the next slide.
