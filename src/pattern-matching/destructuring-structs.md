# Destructuring Structs

You can also destructure `structs`:

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../third_party/rust-by-example/destructuring-structs.rs}}
```

* Change the literal values in `foo` to match with the other patterns.
* Add a new field to `Foo` and make changes to the pattern as needed.
* The distinction between a capture and a constant expression can be hard to
  spot. Try changing the `2` in the second arm to a variable, and see that it subtly
  doesn't work. Change it to a `const` and see it working again.
