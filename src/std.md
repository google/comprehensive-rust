# Standard Library

Rust comes with a standard library which helps establish a set of common types
used by Rust library and programs. This way, two libraries can work together
smoothly because they both use the same `String` type.

The common vocabulary types include:

- [`Option` and `Result`](std/option-result.md) types: used for optional values
  and [error handling](error-handling.md).

- [`String`](std/string.md): the default string type used for owned data.

- [`Vec`](std/vec.md): a standard extensible vector.

- [`HashMap`](std/hashmap.md): a hash map type with a configurable hashing
  algorithm.

- [`Box`](std/box.md): an owned pointer for heap-allocated data.

- [`Rc`](std/rc.md): a shared reference-counted pointer for heap-allocated data.
