# Welcome to Bare Metal Rust

Today we will talk about `bare-metal` Rust: running Rust code without an OS underneath us. This will
be divided into several parts:

 * What is `no_std` Rust?
 * Writing firmware for microcontrollers.
 * Writing bootloader / kernel code for application processors.
 * Some useful crates for bare-metal Rust development.
