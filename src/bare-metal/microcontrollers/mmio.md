# Raw MMIO

Most microcontrollers access peripherals via memory-mapped IO. Let's try turning on an LED on our
micro:bit:

```rust,editable,compile_fail
{{#include examples/src/bin/mmio.rs:Example}}
```

<details>

* GPIO 0 pin 21 is connected to the first column of the LED matrix, and pin 28 to the first row.

Run the example with:

```sh
cargo embed --bin mmio
```
