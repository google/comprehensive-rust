# `probe-rs` and `cargo-embed`

[probe-rs](https://probe.rs/) is a handy toolset for embedded debugging, like
OpenOCD but better integrated.

- SWD (Serial Wire Debug) and JTAG via CMSIS-DAP, ST-Link and J-Link probes
- GDB stub and Microsoft DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) server
- Cargo integration

`cargo-embed` is a cargo subcommand to build and flash binaries, log RTT (Real
Time Transfers) output and connect GDB. It's configured by an `Embed.toml` file
in your project directory.

- [CMSIS-DAP](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/DAP/html/index.html) is an
  Arm standard protocol over USB for an in-circuit debugger to access the
  CoreSight Debug Access Port of various Arm Cortex processors. It's what the
  on-board debugger on the BBC micro:bit uses.
- ST-Link is a range of in-circuit debuggers from ST Microelectronics, J-Link is
  a range from SEGGER.
- The Debug Access Port is usually either a 5-pin JTAG interface or 2-pin Serial
  Wire Debug.
- probe-rs is a library which you can integrate into your own tools if you want
  to.
- The
  [Microsoft Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/)
  lets VSCode and other IDEs debug code running on any supported
  microcontroller.
- cargo-embed is a binary built using the probe-rs library.
- RTT (Real Time Transfers) is a mechanism to transfer data between the debug
  host and the target through a number of ringbuffers.
