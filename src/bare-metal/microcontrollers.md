# Microcontrollers

The `cortex_m_rt` crate provides (among other things) a reset handler for Cortex M microcontrollers.
<!-- mdbook-xgettext: skip -->
```rust,editable,compile_fail
{{#include microcontrollers/examples/src/bin/minimal.rs:Example}}
```

Next we'll look at how to access peripherals, with increasing levels of abstraction.

<details>

* The `cortex_m_rt::entry` macro requires that the function have type `fn() -> !`, because returning
  to the reset handler doesn't make sense.
* Run the example with `cargo embed --bin minimal`
