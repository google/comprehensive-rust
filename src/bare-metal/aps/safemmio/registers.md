# safe-mmio

The [`safe-mmio`] crate provides types to wrap registers that can be read or
written safely.

|             | Can't read    | Read has no side-effects | Read has side-effects |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Can't write |               | [`ReadPure`]             | [`ReadOnly`]          |
| Can write   | [`WriteOnly`] | [`ReadPureWrite`]        | [`ReadWrite`]         |

- Reading `dr` has a side effect: it pops a byte from the receive FIFO.
- Reading `rsr` (and other registers) has no side-effects. It is a 'pure' read.

- There are a number of different crates providing safe abstractions around MMIO
  operations; we recommend the `safe-mmio` crate.
- The difference between `ReadPure` or `ReadOnly` (and likewise between
  `ReadPureWrite` and `ReadWrite`) is whether reading a register can have
  side-effects that change the state of the device, e.g., reading the data
  register pops a byte from the receive FIFO. `ReadPure` means that reads have
  no side-effects, they are purely reading data.
