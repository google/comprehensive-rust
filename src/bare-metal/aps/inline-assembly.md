# Inline assembly

Sometimes we need to use assembly to do things that aren't possible with Rust code. For example,
to make an HVC (hypervisor call) to tell the firmware to power off the system:

```rust,editable,compile_fail
{{#include examples/src/main_psci.rs:main}}
```

(If you actually want to do this, use the [`smccc`][1] crate which has wrappers for all these functions.)

<details>

* PSCI is the Arm Power State Coordination Interface, a standard set of functions to manage system
  and CPU power states, among other things. It is implemented by EL3 firmware and hypervisors on
  many systems.
* The `0 => _` syntax means initialise the register to 0 before running the inline assembly code,
  and ignore its contents afterwards. We need to use `inout` rather than `in` because the call could
  potentially clobber the contents of the registers.
* This `main` function needs to be `#[no_mangle]` and `extern "C"` because it is called from our
  entry point in `entry.S`.
* `_x0`–`_x3` are the values of registers `x0`–`x3`, which are conventionally used by the bootloader
  to pass things like a pointer to the device tree. According to the standard aarch64 calling
  convention (which is what `extern "C"` specifies to use), registers `x0`–`x7` are used for the
  first 8 arguments passed to a function, so `entry.S` doesn't need to do anything special except
  make sure it doesn't change these registers.
* Run the example in QEMU with `make qemu_psci` under `src/bare-metal/aps/examples`.
