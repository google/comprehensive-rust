# Logging

It would be nice to be able to use the logging macros from the [`log`][1] crate. We can do this by
implementing the `Log` trait.

```rust,editable,compile_fail
{{#include examples/src/logger.rs:main}}
```

* The unwrap in `log` is safe because we initialise `LOGGER` before calling `set_logger`.
