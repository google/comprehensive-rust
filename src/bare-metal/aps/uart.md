# Let's write a UART driver

The QEMU 'virt' machine has a [PL011][1] UART, so let's write a driver for that.

```rust,editable
{{#include examples/src/pl011_minimal.rs:Example}}
```

<details>

* Note that `Uart::new` is unsafe while the other methods are safe. This is because as long as the
  caller of `Uart::new` guarantees that its safety requirements are met (i.e. that there is only
  ever one instance of the driver for a given UART, and nothing else aliasing its address space),
  then it is always safe to call `write_byte` later because we can assume the necessary
  preconditions.
* We could have done it the other way around (making `new` safe but `write_byte` unsafe), but that
  would be much less convenient to use as every place that calls `write_byte` would need to reason
  about the safety
* This is a common pattern for writing safe wrappers of unsafe code: moving the burden of proof for
  soundness from a large number of places to a smaller number of places.
