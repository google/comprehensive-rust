# Multiple registers

We can use a struct to represent the memory layout of the UART's registers.

```

* [`#[repr(C)]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#the-c-representation) tells
  the compiler to lay the struct fields out in order, following the same rules as C. This is
  necessary for our struct to have a predictable layout, as default Rust representation allows the
  compiler to (among other things) reorder fields however it sees fit.
