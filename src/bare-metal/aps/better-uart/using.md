# Using it

Let's write a small program using our driver to write to the serial console, and echo incoming
bytes.

```rust,editable,compile_fail
{{#include ../examples/src/main_improved.rs:main}}
```

<details>

* As in the [inline assembly](../inline-assembly.md) example, this `main` function is called from our
  entry point code in `entry.S`. See the speaker notes there for details.
* Run the example in QEMU with `make qemu` under `src/bare-metal/aps/examples`.
