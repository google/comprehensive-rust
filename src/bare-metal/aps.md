# Application processors

So far we've talked about microcontrollers, such as the Arm Cortex-M series. Now let's try writing
something for Cortex-A. For simplicity we'll just work with QEMU's aarch64
['virt'](https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/system/arm/virt.html) board.

<details>

* Broadly speaking, microcontrollers don't have an MMU or multiple levels of privilege (exception
  levels on Arm CPUs, rings on x86), while application processors do.
* QEMU supports emulating various different machines or board models for each architecture. The
  'virt' board doesn't correspond to any particular real hardware, but is designed purely for
  virtual machines.
