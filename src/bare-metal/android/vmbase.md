# vmbase

For VMs running under crosvm on aarch64, the [vmbase][1] library provides a linker script and useful
defaults for the build rules, along with an entry point, UART console logging and more.
<!-- mdbook-xgettext: skip -->
```rust,compile_fail
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

use vmbase::{main, println};

main!(main);

pub fn main(arg0: u64, arg1: u64, arg2: u64, arg3: u64) {
    println!("Hello world");
}
```

<details>

* The `main!` macro marks your main function, to be called from the `vmbase` entry point.
* The `vmbase` entry point handles console initialisation, and issues a PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF to shutdown
  the VM if your main function returns.
