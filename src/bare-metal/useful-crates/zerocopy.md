# `zerocopy`

The [`zerocopy`][1] crate (from Fuchsia) provides traits and macros for safely converting between
byte sequences and other types.
<!-- mdbook-xgettext: skip -->
```rust,editable,compile_fail
{{#include zerocopy-example/src/main.rs:main}}
```

This is not suitable for MMIO (as it doesn't use volatile reads and writes), but can be useful for
working with structures shared with hardware e.g. by DMA, or sent over some external interface.

<details>

* `FromBytes` can be implemented for types for which any byte pattern is valid, and so can safely be
  converted from an untrusted sequence of bytes.
* Attempting to derive `FromBytes` for these types would fail, because `RequestType` doesn't use all
  possible u32 values as discriminants, so not all byte patterns are valid.
* `zerocopy::byteorder` has types for byte-order aware numeric primitives.
* Run the example with `cargo run` under `src/bare-metal/useful-crates/zerocopy-example/`. (It won't
  run in the Playground because of the crate dependency.)
