# `spin`

`std::sync::Mutex` and the other synchronisation primitives from `std::sync` are not available in
`core` or `alloc`. How can we manage synchronisation or interior mutability, such as for sharing
state between different CPUs?

The [`spin`][1] crate provides spinlock-based equivalents of many of these primitives.
<!-- mdbook-xgettext: skip -->
```rust,editable,compile_fail
use spin::mutex::SpinMutex;

static counter: SpinMutex<u32> = SpinMutex::new(0);

fn main() {
    println!("count: {}", counter.lock());
    *counter.lock() += 2;
    println!("count: {}", counter.lock());
}
```

<details>

* Be careful to avoid deadlock if you take locks in interrupt handlers.
* `spin` also has a ticket lock mutex implementation; equivalents of `RwLock`, `Barrier` and `Once`
  from `std::sync`;  and `Lazy` for lazy initialisation.
* The [`once_cell`][2] crate also has some useful types for late initialisation with a slightly
  different approach to `spin::once::Once`.
* The Rust Playground includes `spin`, so this example will run fine inline.
