# Keeping Crates Up to Date

As the OWNER of any third party Chromium dependency, you are
[expected to keep it up to date with any security fixes][0]. It is hoped that we
will soon automate this for Rust crates, but for now, it's still your
responsibility just as it is for any other third party dependency.
