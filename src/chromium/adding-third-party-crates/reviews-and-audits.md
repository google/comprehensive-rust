# Auditing third party crates

Adding new libraries is subject to Chromium's standard [policies][0], but of
course also subject to code review. As you may be bringing in not just a single
crate but also transitive dependencies, there may be a lot of code to review.
On the other hand, safe Rust code can have limited negative side effects.
How should you review it?

Over time Chromium aims to move to a process based around [cargo vet][1].

Meanwhile, for each new crate addition, we are checking for the following:

* Understand why each crate is used. What's the relationship between crates?
  If the build system for each crate contains a `build.rs` or procedural
  macros, work out what they're for. Are they compatible with the way
  Chromium is normally built?
* Check each crate seems to be reasonably well maintained
* Use `cd third-party/rust/chromium_crates_io; cargo audit` to check for
  known vulnerabilities (first you'll need to `cargo install cargo-audit`,
  which ironically involves downloading lots of dependencies from the internet[2])
* Ensure any unsafe code is good enough for the [Rule of Two][3]
* Check for any use of `fs` or `net` APIs
* Read all the code at a sufficient level to look for anything out of place
  that might have been maliciously inserted. (You can't realistically aim
  for 100% perfection here: there's often just too much code.)

These are just guidelines --- work with reviewers from `security@chromium.org`
to work out the right way to become confident of the crate.
