# Chromium Rust policy

Chromium does not yet allow first-party Rust except in rare cases as approved
by Chromium's [Area Tech Leads](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:ATL_OWNERS).

Chromium's policy on third party libraries is outlined [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/adding_to_third_party.md#rust) -
Rust is allowed for third party libraries under various circumstances, including
if they're the best option for performance or for security.

Very few Rust libraries directly expose a C/C++ API, so that means that nearly
all such libraries will require a small amount of first-party glue code.

Because of this, today's course will be heavily focused on:

* Bringing in third-party Rust libraries ("crates")
* Writing glue code to be able to use those crates from Chromium C++.

If this policy changes over time, the course will evolve to keep up.
