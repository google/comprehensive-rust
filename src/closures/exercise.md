# Exercise: Log Filter

Building on the generic logger from this morning, implement a `Filter` which
uses a closure to filter log messages, sending those which pass the filtering
predicate to an inner logger.

```rust,compile_fail
{{#include exercise.rs:setup}}

// TODO: Define and implement `Filter`.

{{#include exercise.rs:main}}
```
