## Useful crates for writing tests

Rust comes with only basic support for writing tests.

Here are some additional crates which we recommend for writing tests:

* [googletest](https://docs.rs/googletest): Comprehensive test assertion library in the tradition of GoogleTest for C++.
* [proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest): Property-based testing for Rust.
* [rstest](https://docs.rs/rstest): Support for fixtures and parameterised tests.
