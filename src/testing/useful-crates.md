# Useful Crates

Rust comes with only basic support for writing tests.

Here are some additional crates which we recommend for writing tests:

- [googletest](https://docs.rs/googletest): Comprehensive test assertion library
  in the tradition of GoogleTest for C++.
- [proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest): Property-based testing for Rust.
- [rstest](https://docs.rs/rstest): Support for fixtures and parameterised
  tests.
