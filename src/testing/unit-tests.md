# Unit Tests

Rust and Cargo come with a simple unit test framework:

- Unit tests are supported throughout your code.

- Integration tests are supported via the `tests/` directory.

Tests are marked with `#[test]`. Unit tests are often put in a nested `tests`
module, using `#[cfg(test)]` to conditionally compile them only when building
tests.

```rust,editable,ignore
fn first_word(text: &str) -> &str {
    match text.find(' ') {
        Some(idx) => &text[..idx],
        None => &text,
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_empty() {
        assert_eq!(first_word(""), "");
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_single_word() {
        assert_eq!(first_word("Hello"), "Hello");
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_multiple_words() {
        assert_eq!(first_word("Hello World"), "Hello");
    }
}
```

- This lets you unit test private helpers.
- The `#[cfg(test)]` attribute is only active when you run `cargo test`.

Run the tests in the playground in order to show their results.
