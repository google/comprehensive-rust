# Keyboard Shortcuts

There are several useful keyboard shortcuts in mdBook:

- <kbd>Arrow-Left</kbd>: Navigate to the previous page.
- <kbd>Arrow-Right</kbd>: Navigate to the next page.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Execute the code sample that has focus.
- <kbd>s</kbd>: Activate the search bar.

- Mention that these shortcuts are standard for `mdbook` and can be useful when
  navigating any `mdbook`-generated site.
- You can demonstrate each shortcut live to the students.
- The <kbd>s</kbd> key for search is particularly useful for quickly finding
  topics that have been discussed earlier.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> will be super important for you since
  you'll do a lot of live coding.
