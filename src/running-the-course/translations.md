# Translations

The course has been translated into other languages by a set of wonderful
volunteers:

* [Brazilian Portuguese][pt-BR] by [@rastringer] and [@hugojacob].
* [Korean][ko] by [@keispace], [@jiyongp] and [@jooyunghan].

Use the language picker in the top-right corner to switch between languages.

## Incomplete Translations

There is a large number of in-progress translations. We link to the most
recently updated translations:

* [Bengali][bn] by [@raselmandol].
* [French][fr] by [@KookaS] and [@vcaen].
* [German][de] by [@Throvn] and [@ronaldfw].
* [Japanese][ja] by [@CoinEZ-JPN] and [@momotaro1105].
