# Translations

The course has been translated into other languages by a set of wonderful
volunteers:

* [Brazilian Portuguese][pt-BR] by [@rastringer] and [@hugojacob].

Use the language picker in the top-right corner to switch between languages.

If you want to help with this effort, please see [our instructions] for how to
get going. Translations are coordinated on the [issue tracker].
