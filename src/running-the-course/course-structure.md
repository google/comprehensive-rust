# Course Structure

> This page is for the course instructor.

The course is fast paced and covers a lot of ground:

* Day 1: Basic Rust, ownership and the borrow checker.
* Day 2: Compound data types,  pattern matching, the standard library.
* Day 3: Traits and generics, error handling, testing, unsafe Rust.

## Deep Dives

In addition to the 3-day class on Rust Fundamentals, we cover some more
specialized topics:

* [Android](../android.md): a half-day course on using Rust for Android platform
  development. This includes interoperability wtih C, C++, and Java.
* [Bare-metal](../welcome-bare-metal.md): a full day class on using Rust for
  bare-metal (embedded) development. Both microcontrollers and application
  processors are covered.
* [Concurrency](../concurrency.md): a full day class on classical as well as
  `async`/`await` concurrency.

## Format

The course is meant to be very interactive and we recommend letting the
questions drive the exploration of Rust!
