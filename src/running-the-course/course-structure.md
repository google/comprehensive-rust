# Course Structure

> This page is for the course instructor.

The course is fast paced and covers a lot of ground:

* Day 1: Basic Rust, ownership and the borrow checker.
* Day 2: Compound data types,  pattern matching, the standard library.
* Day 3: Traits and generics, error handling, testing, unsafe Rust.
* Day 4: Concurrency in Rust and seeing Rust in action.

## Format

The course is meant to be very interactive and we recommend letting the
questions drive the exploration of Rust!
