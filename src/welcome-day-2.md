# Welcome to Day 2

Now that we have seen a fair amount of Rust, we will continue with:

* Structs, enums, methods.

* Pattern matching: destructering enums, structs, and arrays.

* Control flow constructs: `if`, `if let`, `while`, `while let`, `break`, and
  `continue`.

* The Standard Library: `String`, `Option` and `Result`, `Vec`, `HashMap`, `Rc`
  and `Arc`.

* Modules: visibility, paths, and filesystem hierarchy.
