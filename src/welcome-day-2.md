# Welcome to Day 2

Now that we have seen a fair amount of Rust, today will focus on Rust's type
system:

- Pattern matching: extracting data from structures.
- Methods: associating functions with types.
- Traits: behaviors shared by multiple types.
- Generics: parameterizing types on other types.
- Standard library types and traits: a tour of Rust's rich standard library.
