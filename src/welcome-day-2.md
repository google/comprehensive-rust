# Welcome to Day 2

We have covered the foundations of Rust:

- **Basic Types:** Integers, booleans, characters, tuples, and arrays.
- **Control Flow:** `if` expressions, loops, and `match` expressions.
- **Functions:** How to define and call functions.
- **User-Defined Types:** Model data with `struct` and `enum`.
- **References:** Basic borrowing with `&` and `&mut`.

You can now construct any type in Rust and implement basic logic!
