# Welcome to Day 2

Now that we have seen a fair amount of Rust, we will continue with:

* Memory management: stack vs heap, manual memory management, scope-based memory
  management, and garbage collection.

* Ownership: move semantics, copying and cloning, borrowing, and lifetimes.

* Structs and methods.

* The Standard Library: `String`, `Option` and `Result`, `Vec`, `HashMap`, `Rc`
  and `Arc`.

* Modules: visibility, paths, and filesystem hierarchy.
