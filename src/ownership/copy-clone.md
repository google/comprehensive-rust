# Copying and Cloning

While move semantics are the default, certain types are copied by default:

<!-- mdbook-xgettext: skip -->
```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let x = 42;
    let y = x;
    println!("x: {x}");
    println!("y: {y}");
}
```

These types implement the `Copy` trait.

You can opt-in your own types to use copy semantics:

<!-- mdbook-xgettext: skip -->
```rust,editable
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]
struct Point(i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point(3, 4);
    let p2 = p1;
    println!("p1: {p1:?}");
    println!("p2: {p2:?}");
}
```

* After the assignment, both `p1` and `p2` own their own data.
* We can also use `p1.clone()` to explicitly copy the data.

Copying and cloning are not the same thing:

* Copying refers to bitwise copies of memory regions and does not work on arbitrary objects.
* Copying does not allow for custom logic (unlike copy constructors in C++).
* Cloning is a more general operation and also allows for custom behavior by implementing the `Clone` trait.
* Copying does not work on types that implement the `Drop` trait.

In the above example, try the following:

* Add a `String` field to `struct Point`. It will not compile because `String` is not a `Copy` type.
* Remove `Copy` from the `derive` attribute. The compiler error is now in the `println!` for  `p1`.
* Show that it works if you clone `p1` instead.

If students ask about `derive`, it is sufficient to say that this is a way to generate code in Rust
at compile time. In this case the default implementations of `Copy` and `Clone` traits are generated.
