# Mutually Exclusive References / "Aliasing XOR Mutability"

We can use the mutual exclusion of `&T` and `&mut T` references to prevent data from being used before it is ready.

```rust,editable
pub struct QueryResult;
pub struct DatabaseConnection {/* fields omitted */}

impl DatabaseConnection {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {}
    }
    pub fn results(&self) -> &[QueryResult] {
        &[] // fake results
    }
}

pub struct Transaction<'a> {
    connection: &'a mut DatabaseConnection,
}

impl<'a> Transaction<'a> {
    pub fn new(connection: &'a mut DatabaseConnection) -> Self {
        Self { connection }
    }
    pub fn query(&mut self, _query: &str) {
        // Send the query over, but don't wait for results.
    }
    pub fn commit(self) {
        // Finish executing the transaction and retrieve the results.
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut db = DatabaseConnection::new();

    // The transaction `tx` mutably borrows `db`.
    let mut tx = Transaction::new(&mut db);
    tx.query("SELECT * FROM users");

    // This won't compile because `db` is already mutably borrowed.
    // let results = db.results(); // ‚ùåüî®

    // The borrow of `db` ends when `tx` is consumed by `commit`.
    tx.commit();

    // Now it is possible to borrow `db` again.
    let results = db.results();
}
```

- Motivation: In this database API queries are kicked off for asynchronous execution and the results are only available once the whole transaction is finished. A user might think that
  queries are executed immediately, and try to read results before they are made available. This
  API misuse could make the app read incomplete or incorrect data.

  While an obvious misunderstanding, situations such as this can happen in
  practice.

  Ask: Has anyone misunderstood an API by not reading the docs for proper use?

  Expect: Examples of early-career or in-university mistakes and
  misunderstandings.

  As an API grows in size and user base, a smaller percentage of users has deep
  knowledge of the system the API represents.

- This example shows how we can use Aliasing XOR Mutability to prevent this kind of
  misuse.

- The code might read results before they are ready if the programmer assumes that the
  queries execute immediately rather than
  kicked off for asynchronous execution.

- The constructor for the `Transaction` type takes a mutable reference to the
  database connection, and stores it in the returned `Transaction` value.

  The explicit lifetime here doesn't have to be intimidating, it just means
  "`Transaction` is outlived by the `DatabaseConnection` that was passed to it"
  in this case.

  The reference is mutable to completely lock out the `DatabaseConnection` from other usage, such as starting further transactions or reading the results.

- While a `Transaction` exists, we can't touch the `DatabaseConnection` variable
  that was created from it.

  Demonstrate: uncomment the `db.results()` line.


- As laid out in [generalizing ownership](generalizing-ownership.md) and
  [the opening slide for this section](../borrow-checker-invariants.md) we can
  look at the ways Mutable References and Shareable References interact to see
  if they fit with the invariants we want to uphold for an API.

- Note: The query results not being public and placed behind a getter function
  lets us enforce the invariant "users can only look at query results if there
  is no active transactions."

  If the query results were placed in a public struct field,
  this invariant could be violated.
