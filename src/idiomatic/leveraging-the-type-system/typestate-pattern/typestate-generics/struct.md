## Serializer: implement Struct

```rust
# use std::fmt::Write as _;
{{#include ../typestate-generics.rs:Serializer-def}}

{{#include ../typestate-generics.rs:Struct-def}}
{{#include ../typestate-generics.rs:Property-def}}

{{#include ../typestate-generics.rs:Struct-impl}}
```

The diagram can now be expanded as follows:

```bob
                                                         +------+
                                                 finish  |      |
                           serialize             struct  V      |
                           struct
+---------------------+ --------------> +-----------------------------+
| Serializer [ Root ] |                 | Serializer [ Struct [ S ] ] |
+---------------------+ <-------------- +-----------------------------+
                          finish struct
         |                                        serialize   |
         |                                        property    V
         |
finish   |                            +------------------------------------------+
         V                            | Serializer [ Property [ Struct [ S ] ] ] |
                                      +------------------------------------------+
     +--------+
     | String |
     +--------+
```

<details>

- A `Struct` can only contain a `Property`;

- Finishing a `Struct` returns control back to its parent, which in our previous
  slide was assumed the `Root`, but in reality however it can be also something
  else such as `Struct` in case of nested "structs".
