Names and Signatures are not full documentation

```rust
```

<details>
- Motivation: API designers can over-commit to the idea that a function name and signature is enough documentation.

It's better than nothing, but it's worse than good documentation.

- Again, names and types are _part_ of the documentation. They are not always
  the full story!

- TODO: give some rules of thumb for when to go into more detail,
  cross-reference rust stdlib docs. This may live better in the name conventions
  area.

</details>
