# Who are you writing for?

Colleagues, collaborators, largely-silent API users, or just yourself?

```rust
// TODO: What's a good illustration here?
```

<details>
- Motivation: It can be easy to fall into a pattern of writing only for you, but most documentation is for people coming in with a different perspective.

- Unintentionally writing for yourself can lead to people not understanding a
  point you're trying to make or the concept you're trying to articulate.

- Imagine a version of you, or others you've known, struggling to find practical
  information while going through documentation.

  Keep this idea of a person in mind when thinking about what areas of a
  codebase need attention for doc comments.

- Who are you writing for?

- Also imagine a version of you, or others you've known, who is struggling to
  find the important details in winding, extensive doc comments. Don't give too
  much information.
- Always ask: Is this documentation making it difficult for the API user? Are
  they able to quickly grasp what they need or find out where they could need
  it?
