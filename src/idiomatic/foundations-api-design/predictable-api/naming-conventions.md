# Naming Conventions

<details>
- One core component of readability and predictability is the way function names are composed.

A formal and consistently-applied naming convention lets developers treat names
like a domain-specific language and quickly understand the functionality and use
cases of a method.

Rust's community developed naming conventions early, making them mostly
consistent in places like the standard library.

- Here we'll learn common components of Rust method names, giving examples from
  the standard library and some context to go with them.
