# To

Prefix to a function that takes a borrowed value and creates an owned value

```rust
String::to_owned // &str -> String (&str is not consumed)
```

<details>
- Method for a function from a borrowed value to owned value.

Not an escape hatch to make something borrowed into something owned, instead
creates a new owned value.

May transform the data in some way! May return an entirely different type. This
is what makes it different from clone.

Example: to_uppercase creates a version of a string with all uppercase letters.

- Tends to not consume source value.

- Also seen in functions that convert the endianness of primitives, or copy and
  expose the value of a newtype.
