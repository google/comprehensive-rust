# By

Component for methods that take a custom projection or comparison function.

```rust
slice::sort_by
// caches the projection
slice::sort_by_key
Iterator::min_by
```

<details>
- Method will take a projection function.

- Most often seen in methods that sort or otherwise manipulate a slice with a
  custom sort or comparison function rather than by the `Ord` implementation of
  the type itself.

- Contradiction: `advance_by` iterator method (nightly feature)
