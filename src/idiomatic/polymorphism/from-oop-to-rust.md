# From OOP to Rust: Composition, Not Inheritance

- Inheritance is key to OOP's success as a paradigm. Decades of successful
  software engineering has been done with Inheritance as a core part of business
  logic.

- So why did Rust avoid inheritance?

- How do we move from inheritance-based problem solving to Rust's approach?

- How do you represent heterogeneous collections in Rust?

<details>

- In this section we'll be looking at how to move from thinking about
  polymorphic problem solving with types in OOP languages like java, C++ etc. to
  Rust's trait-based approach to Polymorphism.

- There will be differences, but there are also plenty of areas in common –
  especially with modern standards of OOP development. Remember to keep an open
  mind.
